## Lala-dle
A standalone frontend webapp that fetches song information
with the goal of calculating what percentage of the lyrics
are made up of nonsense words such as "lalala".<br>

This project has been inspired by my personal perception
that modern music is more and more being shaped by fun beats and
'feel good vibes' at the expense of meaningful messages. <br>
Consider this the revolution, lets take back our lyrics! /j 

As a simple personal project there is no backend and the
app makes extensive use of the following free APIs:<br>
 - MusicBrainz (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API)
 - lrclib (https://lrclib.net/docs)

Both are great services but the website does suffer slightly
at the cost of MusicBrainz's rate limiting in particular.
